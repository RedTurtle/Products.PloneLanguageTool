Changelog for PloneLanguageTool

   (name of developer listed in brackets)

PloneLanguageTool 0.9 - Released December 18, 2005

    - Fix http://trac.plone.org/plone/ticket/4959 - if the default language was
      not contained in the supported languages the config form showed a false
      default language and the form had to be saved again to get the desired
      result. Now in this special case the default language is set to the first
      supported language.

    - Added removeCountry and removeLanguage methods as counterpart for the
      corresponding add-methods. Added some basic tests.

      if the content should start as language neutral or in the current
      selected language.
